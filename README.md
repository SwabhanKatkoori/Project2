## Project 2
Created by Swabhan Katkoori and Ryan Hanks

Within this project we both have done 3 sections related to the project specs

#### Swabhan Katkoori
1. Painting effects, which you draw over the image on a frame by frame basis, perhaps to make it appear drawn.
2. Some interesting non-linear image warp. (Ripple)
3. Image recoloring where colors in the image are selectively changed. Your solution must be example driven, meaning there must be before and after images that determine how the recoloring is performed

#### Ryan Hanks
1. Added prop or character. The added item should appear to be a seamless element of the video.
2. Some warp that manipulates elements of an item added as in #3 above. Possibilities include South Park style flapping heads, wings that flap, arms that move, etc.
3. Implement chromakeying using green background replacement.
